# .NET Core Microservices - The Complete Guide (.NET 8 MVC)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for the Udemy course [".NET Core Microservices - The Complete Guide (.NET 6 MVC)"](https://lg.udemy.com/course/net-core-microservices-the-complete-guide-net-6-mvc/learn/lecture/38026986#overview). The course provides a comprehensive introduction to microservices using .NET 6 and ASP.NET Core MVC.


### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# and .NET Core
- Familiarity with web development concepts
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code installed

### Course Modules

1. **Introduction to Microservices**  
   Understanding microservices architecture, its advantages, and why companies are shifting towards this design.

2. **Building Microservices with ASP.NET Core**  
   Learn how to develop individual microservices using .NET 6 and ASP.NET Core. Understand the development lifecycle of microservices and how to structure them for scalability.

3. **Service Communication**  
   Implement communication between microservices using REST, RabbitMQ for message-driven architecture, and gRPC for real-time communication.

4. **API Gateway with Ocelot**  
   Configure an API Gateway using Ocelot to route requests between different microservices and improve scalability and security.

5. **Docker for Microservices**  
   Learn how to containerize microservices using Docker. Understand the concepts of container orchestration with Docker Compose.

6. **Securing Microservices**  
   Integrate Identity Server 4 to handle authentication and authorization securely across your services.

7. **Event-Driven Architecture with MassTransit**  
   Explore event-driven communication with MassTransit and RabbitMQ, allowing microservices to react asynchronously to events.

8. **Logging and Monitoring**  
   Implement logging with Serilog, centralized logging using ELK stack, and monitor your microservices using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance metrics.
